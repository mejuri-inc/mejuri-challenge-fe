# Test Css Developer

Thanks for participating in this evaluation, we are happy to see what you can do and how you can improve our product! At Mejuri we value a lot the knowledge every individual brings, what it can teach us and vice versa.

The idea of this test is that you show us your skills in a simple project that shouldn’t take you too long,  your time is important to us.

### The skills that we want to see are:
- HTML & CSS
- Cross browser compatibility
- SEO
- Accessibility


## UI 
We don’t care what framework you use, it could be plain html, react, angular, css, sass, less, etc. Choose the one that is easiest for you. 

You will find attached to this a folder called assets. 
Inside you have an editable figma file (assets/editable.fig) , but if you don't have figma don’t worry, because you have the JPG (assets/page-desktop.jpg | tablet | mobile) for every size too. 


**Important details:**
- We would like to see some animations, the ones that you prefer.
- Text elements have to adapt to different amounts of content without breaking layout.
- It should look ok in Safari and Chrome for mobile and desktop. 
- We sent you a tablet view as reference, but it is nice to have.
- We sent you a Header and footer as reference, but it is nice to have.


You can send this as a github repository, pull request, or upload the page somewhere.
